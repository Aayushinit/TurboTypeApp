## 🎯 Why It Stands Out

> “It may look simple, but it teaches complex skills recruiters love.”

- **Full-stack integration:** HTML → JavaScript → Flask API → JSON roundtrip  
- **Asynchronous logic:** Live DOM events, keystroke tracking, and real-time rendering  
- **UI polish & UX focus:** Progress bar, theme toggle, adaptive layout  
- **Extensible backend:** Future support for login, leaderboard, or multiplayer modes

## 📚 Highlights & Learnings

- Flask routes, API building, and CORS management  
- JavaScript event handling and performance tracking  
- Clean, responsive UI architecture from scratch  
- Real-time frontend–backend communication with JSON  
- Debugging and logging for production-level code  
- Accessibility and dark mode integration
